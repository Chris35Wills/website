## FOSS4G:UK Local 2022

We ran FOSS4G:UK Local 2022 on *Thu 17 Nov 2022*. This was a hybrid conference, but with a twist: there was no central physical location. We had 9 venues geographically dispersed across the UK, and online access. Videos of the presentations are available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FOSS4GUK/streams) with links on each venue page. 

You are also welcome to continue chatting with participants through the OSGeo:UK Matrix Room: [#OSGeoUK:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#OSGeoUK:matrix.org). Check out this [page](https://nickbearman.github.io/installing-software/element-matrix-public) for details on how to sign up. All participants are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/code-of-conduct). 

 The full agenda for all venues, with links to each session is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ChtOtqO0PfZ2ckiZqqJxyV3VhP3Xm-WnkJ6NwZ2UVTM).
