### FOSS4G:UK Local 2023

We have a confirmed date for FOSS4G:UK Local 2023 - **Thurs 7th Sept 2023**.

We currently have seven venues:

- Lancaster
- Keyworth
- London
- Swansea
- [Bristol](bristol.html)
- Glasgow
- Maynooth

We have two amazing keynotes who are keen to present - we will announce them when they are confirmed. We will also have a panel discussion provisionally titled: *Where have we gone in the last ten years and where will be in ten years time?*. 

We are adopting a similar structure to last year, with the keynotes and panel discussion streamed to all venues and to YouTube. 

More details to follow, but save the date in your diary. 

If you are interested in volunteering at one of the venues above, or would like to run your own venue, please get in touch via [our mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/uk){:target="_newpage"}, [our Matrix Chat Room](https://matrix.to/#/%23OSGeoUK:matrix.org){:target="_newpage"} or <span class="osgeoemail"></span>.

Participants at FOSS4G:UK Local 2023 are expected to act respectfully toward others in accordance with the [FOSS4G:UK Online Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct). *Short version: everyone is welcome, make everyone welcome, be nice.*
